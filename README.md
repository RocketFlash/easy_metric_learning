## Conda environment
Easiest way to work with this repo is to install conda environment from file. First you need to install conda. And then run the following:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will install a new conda environment with all the required libraries.

## Manually

If you want to install all required libraries without conda you can instal them manually. First install [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Next it's possible to install all required libraries using requirements.txt file. Just run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
